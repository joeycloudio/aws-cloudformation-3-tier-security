🚀 Deploying & Securing a 3-Tier Architecture with AWS CloudFormation
A hands-on AWS CloudFormation project designed to build a secure, scalable, and resilient 3-tier cloud architecture.

📌 Project Overview
This CloudFormation template automates the deployment of a secure 3-tier architecture in AWS with a focus on security best practices and scalability.

✔ Built for security → IAM roles, Security Groups, Network ACLs, Secrets Manager.
✔ Designed for high availability → Multi-tier infrastructure with public/private subnets.
✔ Automated with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) → AWS CloudFormation YAML template.

🔹 This project serves as a foundational AWS architecture, but is not production-ready (e.g., missing ACM for full HTTPS support).

🔧 Architecture Components
Networking: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), public/private subnets, Network ACLs.
Compute: EC2 instances for application & database tiers.
Storage & Database: Amazon RDS (private subnet), Secrets Manager for credentials.
Security: IAM roles, Security Groups, CloudWatch logging.
Load Balancing: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic distribution.
