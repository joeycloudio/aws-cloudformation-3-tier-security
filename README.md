## Project Overview

This CloudFormation template automates the deployment of a **secure 3-tier architecture** in AWS, with an emphasis on **security best practices** and **scalability**.

Problem Statement
Deploying a secure, scalable web application manually is time-consuming and prone to security misconfigurations.

Business Impact
âœ… Reduces infrastructure costs by provisioning only whatâ€™s needed.
âœ… Increases security by enforcing best practices (e.g., private subnets, IAM roles).
âœ… Simplifies scaling by using Load Balancers & Auto Scaling groups.

How Companies Use This
Startups & enterprises automate cloud deployment to onboard applications quickly without manual work.
    

_Note: The project is designed for educational purposes. It is not yet production-ready (e.g., lacks ACM support for full HTTPS)._

## Architecture Components

*   **Networking**: VPC, subnets, security groups, Network ACLs.
    
*   **Compute**: EC2 instances for the application and database tiers.
    
*   **Database**: Amazon RDS (private subnet), using Secrets Manager for credentials.
    
*   **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for distributing traffic.
    
*   **Security**: IAM roles, security groups, CloudWatch monitoring.

## Repository Structure

*   README.md â€“ This file
    
*   [cloudformation-template.yaml](https://github.com/joeycloudio/aws-cloudformation-3-tier-security/blob/main/3-tier-security-demo.yml) â€“ CloudFormation template for deploying resources

<br>    

## Key Takeaways from This Project

*   Hands-on experience deploying a 3-tier architecture with AWS CloudFormation.
    
*   Strengthened understanding of **VPCs, IAM roles, security best practices**.
    
*   Learned how to debug **CloudFormation templates** and resolve issues.
    
*   Gained insights into using **CloudWatch** for system monitoring.

<br> 

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement **ACM for HTTPS support** to ensure secure connections.
    
*   Add **Auto Scaling** to scale resources based on demand.
    
*   Enhance **monitoring and logging** with CloudTrail and AWS Config.
